# solar-system-kepler-3rd-law
this project uses pygame as its drawing tool.
in this project i used Kepler's third law to determine planets period around their sun.
as an example i used solar system planets as my reference objects.
the planet's period is calculated by a function Pcal that uses third law of Kepler.
and i needed a Rotator class for rotating an object in the time dt, by a given period.
for simplicity i assumed that every planet have a cicrular morbit(which is not entirely true).
all planet info i needed got from internet.
if you think you can make my code better, let me know.
